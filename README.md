# DigiTrafficInspector-MobileApp
An android app targeted to be used by the public as well as traffic inspectors for capturing traffic violations and reporting them to the main authority to check the legitimacy of the report and act accordingly. The app is supported by OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for capturing documents like driving license, insurance paper, etc. The app also provides a self-assessment score based on the user's activity. The app is designed to work parallelly with a web portal to be used to monitor the cases registered and verify them based upon the pieces of evidence submitted by the user. Additionally, it can also help to locate the traffic violation hotspots on the map. Also, it provides a mechanism to filter all the previous records of a specific vehicle.
